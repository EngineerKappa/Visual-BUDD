# Visual BUDD

Hiya! This is my WIP visual novel framework for [SGDK](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK)! It's pretty hacky right now, though. I'm pretty new to C.

I highly recommend checking out the SGDK repo for info on how to build this, and working with SGDK in general. I also tend to look at [Pigsy's Retro Game Dev Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1xqkpO_SvY2_rSwHTBIBxXMqmek--GAb) pretty often.
